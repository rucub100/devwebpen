# üåê webpen: A Developer's Swiss Army Knife for Web Applications üñäÔ∏è

Are you tired of juggling multiple tools for API testing and web security? Webpen is a desktop application that streamlines your workflow by combining essential features found in tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, and [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. While those powerhouses excel in specialized areas, webpen focuses on providing a modern, user-friendly experience for everyday web development and security testing.

Designed with developers and security professionals in mind, webpen empowers you to:

- **Test APIs:** Send requests, analyze responses, and automate your API testing workflow.
- **Scan for Vulnerabilities:** Identify security risks in your web applications with integrated scanning tools.
- **Develop Securely:** Integrate security testing seamlessly into your development process.

## Concepts

This section provides a deeper dive into the core concepts and design choices behind `webpen`.

### Architecture

- **Frontend:** Tauri + React + TypeScript (responsible for the user interface and user interactions)
- **Backend (core):** Rust (handles core logic, data processing, and communication with the daemon)
- **Daemon:** Java (provides long-running tasks, background processing, and potentially interacts with external services)
- **Communication:** gRPC (efficient and secure communication between the Tauri app and the Java daemon)
